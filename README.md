# PUBG PAK Inject
## [Introducing]()
 The game PUBG(PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) which is based on Unreal Engine 4 uses *.pak files to encrypt and pack game resource files.
 Ever since its early access, a lot of hackers had been exploited these vulnerable PAKs to modify game resources to benefit from it.
 Even after PUBG launched its official version, this exploit never been patched well.
 However, latest patch (v6.2.7.5) patched over-an-year method to bypass the checksum.

 Later that patch, PUBG also handled with this method(let's say Timing method). Timing method itself is now patched.
 As PUBG file management is not that strict, however, another method combined with Timing method is working perfectly.

## [So what is it?]()
 This is ANOTHER ~~ANOTHER~~ METHOD against latest patch to inject pak (Yes, literally, inject).

## [What you have to do]()
 That's all. It's already undetectable by BattleEye or Xigncode (whatever they use to protect client from modified).
 Take a look at it, Compile it, And Benefit :D

## [Things to Notice before use]()
 I've seen some people get banned using 'Colored player PAK's. I suggest you'd better use it with something to prevent BattleEye from capture your screen.
